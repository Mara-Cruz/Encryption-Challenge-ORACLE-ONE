# ENCRYPTION WEBSITE

## The challenge

This project was created for the Encryption challenge of ORACLE ONE NEXT EDUCATION - ALURA LATAM 2023.

The goal was to develop a responsive encryption website that aligns with the provided designs found at: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/trP3p5nEh7XUyB3n2bomjP/Alura-Challenge---Desaf%C3%ADo-1---L%C3%B3gica) and fulfill the following criteria:

- Develop an application for text encryption using the following substitution rules:
  <ul>
    <li> Replace "e" with "enter"</li>
    <li> Replace "i" with "imes"</li>
    <li> Replace "a" with "ai"</li>
    <li> Replace "o" with "ober"</li>
    <li> Replace "u" with "ufat"</li>
  </ul>
- The application should only support lowercase letters and exclude accented letters and special characters.
- Enable bidirectional conversions; the application should be capable of both encrypting and decrypting text (e.g., "gato" => "gaitober" or "gaitober" => "gato").
- The webpage must provide dedicated input fields for text, offering options for both encryption and decryption. The interface must display immediate results.
- Additionally, include a button to easily copy encrypted or decrypted text to the clipboard."
